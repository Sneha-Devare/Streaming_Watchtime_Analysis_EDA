# 📊 Streaming Watchtime Analysis

Welcome to the **Streaming Watchtime Analysis** project!  
This project focuses on exploring how users interact with a streaming platform — what they watch, how long they watch, and from where — to discover patterns that can help improve user satisfaction and reduce churn.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a streaming dataset to answer key business questions like:

- 🎥 **What kind of content do users prefer?** (Movies or TV Shows, Comedy or Drama)
- ⏱️ **How much time do they spend watching content?**
- 📈 **Which content is the most popular?**
- 📱 **What devices are they using?** (Mobile, Laptop, Smart TV)
- 🌍 **From which locations are users streaming?**
- 📉 **Are there any patterns that indicate user drop-off or low engagement?**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

The analysis was done using Python and the following libraries:

- `pandas`, `numpy` – for data loading and manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` – for creating detailed and interactive visualizations  
- `ydata_profiling` – to generate a quick and automated profiling report  
- `warnings` – to suppress unnecessary output and keep the notebook clean

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed records of user watchtime behavior, including:

- Content types (Movies, Shows)
- Watch duration
- User location
- Device used for streaming
- Content genres and names

📥 The dataset was loaded using `pandas.read_csv()` and initially inspected with `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` functions.

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning** 🧹  
   - Checked for missing values, data types, and duplicates  
   - Performed necessary preprocessing for analysis

2. **Univariate Analysis** 📊  
   - Analyzed individual columns like content type, devices, locations, and watchtime

3. **Bivariate Analysis** 📈  
   - Compared variables like device vs. content type, genre vs. watchtime, etc.

4. **Visualizations** 🖼️  
   - Used bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and interactive plots with `plotly` to understand data patterns

5. **Insights Generation** 💡  
   - Derived actionable insights about user preferences and behavior

---

## ✅ Outcomes

- 👁️ Identified the **most watched content types and genres**
- 📍 Tracked **popular streaming locations and devices**
- ⏰ Measured **average and total watchtime**
- 📊 Highlighted **user engagement trends**
- 💼 These insights can help the company improve its content strategy and enhance user experience

## 📌 Conclusion

This project provides valuable business insights into user streaming habits and preferences.  
It helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to retain users and deliver content they love. ❤️
